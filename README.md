# Python-Digital-Clock



This Python Project is a simple demonstration of a digital clock made using some external python module.
<br>
In This Python-Digital-Clock , I created a simple digital clock using an external python module called "Turtle" and also using so inbuilt module like "date","datetime"! . Such type of digital clocks can also be used at higher level 
<br>
#Project PreRequistics 
This project was made using "Turtle" , "Date" , "Datetime" modules and also using some basic functions of python!
<br>
1)Turtle : To create a rectangular box , a screen and represent the time for the digital clock. It can also be further modified for higher level digitaal clocks
<br>
2)Date : To allow the program to input and work with the current date
<br>
3)DateTime : To input the current date and time and allow the program to use it in the digital clock
